✅ Project : 
Star5 Intelligence, an AI SaaS solution based on Natural Language Processing to track and measure consumer perception of brands and products.

✅ Project Description :
Star5 is a SaaS solution, that uses NLP techniques and Artificial Intelligence to retrieve insights from online collected reviews, the platform offer an easy-to-use interface to know the consumers points of view in several areas (price, delivery, performance, etc.) whether on the brand or the products, and also in an instantaneous way.

✅ Tasks realized :
 * Multi-Label Classification Engine : classify reviews.
 * Keyword Extraction Engine : extract keyword from reviews.
 * Text Similarity Engine : calculate similarity between two segments of text.
 * Text Segmentation Engine : segmenting reviews into sentences.
 * Sentiment Analysis Engine : detecting sentiment of sentences.
 * Text Summarization Engine : summarizing documents and reviews.
 * Named Entity Recognition Engines : building a specific usecase for NER.

✅ Deep Learning Architecture : 
 * RNN | LSTM | GRU | SEQ2SEQ | Attention Mechanisms | Transformers.

✅ Transformers Models used:
 * BERT | DistillBert | ULMFiT | T5 | CamemBERT.

✅ Cloud Providers :
 * AWS : Amazon SageMaker | AWS Lambda | AWS API Gateway.
 * Azure : | Azure VM's.

❖ Other :
 * Word Embeddings : Glove | FastText | Word2vec.
 * Libraries:  PyTorch | Tensorflow | Transformers library by Hugging Face | Fastai | NLTK | Spacy | Sickit-Learn....
 * Model deployment : AWS SageMaker EndPoints & API's | FLask APP on a docker container.
 * Version Controling : Git (GitLab)
 * Other techniques : Data Augmentation, Data Labeling.
