## Who Am I? and My Objectives

Ambitious data scientist with a passion for machine learning, natural language processing and deep learning. I am passionate about working with data, and always a keen learner about Machine Learning and new techniques. Looking for challenging data science projects, using my current skill set to create data-driven solutions and improving my skills towards artificial intelligence.

Trying to become a data scientist who is not only willing to get hands dirty and dig into numbers, but also capable of driving successful business solutions with creative ideas.

I love to read AI blogs, watch YouTube tutorials and listen to AI podcasts. I am learning so much from the AI community, where knowledge is shared to challenge the boundary of computer intelligence. In addition, as an NLP Practitioner, I love to read, publish and  discuss recent research papers in Deep Learning and open-source projects, and also love applying state-of-the-art technologies in NLP.


Always love a good conversation, feel free to reach out to me about anything tech, fitness or coffee!
