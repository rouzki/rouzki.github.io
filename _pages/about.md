## About me

My name is Chris Tran. I am a Machine Learning Engineer with industry experiences in Deep Learning, NLP and Computer Vision. I am currently a Computer Vision Intern at Etsy, where I develop Deep Learning frameworks to improve personalization and image-based recommendations. Besides that, I works as a part-time Machine Learning Researcher at Skim AI Technologies, where I apply latest research in Deep Learning NLP to make machines understand human languages better. Projects I worked on include Named Entity Recognition (NER), Document Classification, large-scale Sentiment Analysis and Summarization.

I am pursuing a STEM masterâ€™s degree at the University of Rochester, where I receive solid training in Statistics, Machine Learning and Programming. I am proficient in Python and R programming languages, data retrieval and processing with SQL, data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I am interested in working with large datasets, including cleaning, connecting and mining data. I have completed Data Science projects and Kaggle competitions, where I built, tuned and ensembled machine learning models including Regresisons (Ridge, Lasso), Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost and LightGBM. I am very proficient at using PyTorch to build and deploy cutting-egde AI systems to solve NLP and CV problems. More details about these projects can be found below:
